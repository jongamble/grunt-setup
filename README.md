Grunt Setup Structure

Created: November 2013
By: Jon Gamble

Description:

This is just a small starting file structure and prebuilt grunt file for how I plan to use it the majority of the time.

Feel free to use/modify/distribute however you like. If you like it, let me know. If you want to change it, fork it.
